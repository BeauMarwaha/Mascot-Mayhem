Mascot Mayhem Rules: 

Once you select "Play Game" in the menu you will be taken to a map selection screen. 
Once you select a map you will be taken to a team selection screen where each player will select a team to play.
Once both teams are selected the game begins.

The first player will go first. Their units are stationed on the left side of the screen and won't be darkened out.
To move a unit, first click on its title. The possible tiles that it can move to will be highlighted. Click on a 
highlighted tile to move to that tile.

After the player has selected a tile to move to, they have the ability to attack an enemy within its range. 
Available enemies to attack will have a highlighted tile beneath them, normal attacks will be marked by a 
white square, special attacks by a red X. Clicking the tile results in the attack. 

Each unit type on a player's team has unique characteristic's and stats associated with it. These are displayed
on the bottom left and right corners of the screen. 

Each team also has one special mascot unit. This unit is more powerful than other units and also has a special move, 
which may be used instead of an attack.

Once you have moved all your units or you decide to end your turn, click on an empty tile on the board.
This will bring up a menu where you can resume the game, end your turn, return to the main menu, or exit the game. 

In order to win, a college will have to either kill the enemy mascot unit and/or, depending on the map chosen, capture
a specially marked "Win Tile" located on the map by occupying the full 2x2 space for 2 full continuous turns.
