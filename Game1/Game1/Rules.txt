Mascot Mayhem Rules: *Note these rules apply to ONLY the Milestone 2 version of the game

Once you select "Play Game" in the menu you will be taken to a map selection screen.
Once you select a map you will be taken to a team selection screen where each player will select a team to play.
Once both teams are selected the game begins.

The first player will go first and their units will be stationed on the left side of the screen and will not be darkened out.
To move a unit first click on its tile and the possible tiles that it can move to will be highlighted with a white box.
Click on a highlighted tile to move there. 

After the player has selected a tile to move to they would normally be able to attack enemy units within range, 
however, this has not been implemented yet.

Each unit type on a player's team has unique characteristics which will be displayed to the player in a later version
of the game.

Each team also has one special mascot unit which is typically more powerful than other units and also has a special move, 
which can be used instead of an attack.
(Note: the mascots' special moves have not yet been added to the game)

Once you have moved all your units or you decide that your turn is done click on an empty tile on the board.
From there you can resume the game, end your turn, return to the menu (this will reset the game), or exit the game.

In order to win a college team will have to either kill the enemy mascot unit and/or, depending on the map, capture a 
specially marked "Win Tile" located somewhere on the board by occupying its space with one of its units for a number of turns.
(Win states and their checks also still need to be implemented in the game)
